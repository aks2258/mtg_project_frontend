### Inspiration
After I got back into the popular card game Magic the Gathering, I saw that my deck build needed upgrading and searched for recommended deck builds by other people that used the cards I wanted to use. A lot of search results led me to forums where other players would list cards and their deck builds and often ask for reviews or recommendations of cards to use. This led me to want to build a site where people can build their decks and serve as an all-in-one deck builder and review/recommendation. This current version is only the first part of what I hope to build.
